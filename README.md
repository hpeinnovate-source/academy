# Web Application Workshop

1. Understand Git Repository - Directory and Branch Structure
    https://github.com/hpeinnovate-source/academy
    Each group will have own dedicated Branch
    hpe.innovate@gmail.com / Pass...
    hpeinnovate-source / myHPEpass...

    Use GitHub Pages to publish site:
    https://hpeinnovate-source.github.io/academy

    

2. Understand the wrrt.in backend
    https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in

3. Leverage Copilot to develop HTML, CSS and JS code
    https://copilot.microsoft.com/

4. Leverage Codepen to test the code before adding to branch
    https://codepen.io/pen/

5. Once code is tested and finalized in Codepen, bring that code into your branch on GitHub

6. Create a pull request to merge into (main) branch

7. Merge final (main) into gh-pages for publishing

# Resources
## 🚀 React

CodeSandbox → Best choice for React apps. Supports React + TypeScript, integrates with GitHub, and has live preview.
👉 codesandbox.io

StackBlitz → Also strong for React; everything runs in the browser with lightning-fast setup.
👉 stackblitz.com

Replit → Full React projects are supported, with instant hosting + collaboration.
👉 replit.com

## 🌐 Node.js (full-stack)

StackBlitz → Lets you spin up Node.js servers right in the browser (no installs).

CodeSandbox → Supports server-side Node with APIs + frontend in one project.

Replit → Great for Node apps, REST APIs, and even socket servers.

## 🐍 Flask / Python

Replit → The easiest way to run Flask. Comes with a web server, live preview, and ability to share projects.

PythonAnywhere → More traditional web IDE, designed for Python web hosting; good for deploying small Flask apps.
👉 pythonanywhere.com

Glitch (until mid-2025) → Was often used for Flask demos, but they’re shutting down free hosting — still works short-term.

📚 Recommendation

For React & Node.js → Start with CodeSandbox or StackBlitz (fastest, least setup).

For Flask/Python → Use Replit (simple, collaborative, and keeps things running).
