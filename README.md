# Resources
## 🚀 React

CodeSandbox → Best choice for React apps. Supports React + TypeScript, integrates with GitHub, and has live preview.
👉 codesandbox.io

StackBlitz → Also strong for React; everything runs in the browser with lightning-fast setup.
👉 stackblitz.com

Replit → Full React projects are supported, with instant hosting + collaboration.
👉 replit.com

## 🌐 Node.js (full-stack)

StackBlitz → Lets you spin up Node.js servers right in the browser (no installs).

CodeSandbox → Supports server-side Node with APIs + frontend in one project.

Replit → Great for Node apps, REST APIs, and even socket servers.

## 🐍 Flask / Python

Replit → The easiest way to run Flask. Comes with a web server, live preview, and ability to share projects.

PythonAnywhere → More traditional web IDE, designed for Python web hosting; good for deploying small Flask apps.
👉 pythonanywhere.com

Glitch (until mid-2025) → Was often used for Flask demos, but they’re shutting down free hosting — still works short-term.

📚 Recommendation

For React & Node.js → Start with CodeSandbox or StackBlitz (fastest, least setup).

For Flask/Python → Use Replit (simple, collaborative, and keeps things running).
